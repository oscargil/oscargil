## Projects Portfolio

Here are some of the projects I'm working on or have completed, showcasing my skills in Software Engineering and AI/ML:

* **[AI Classification API with Django & Docker](https://github.com/oscargil/ai-classification-api)**
    * *Description:* Developed a production-ready REST API that serves real-time predictions for Iris flower classification. The API is built with Django REST Framework and uses a Logistic Regression model trained on the classic Iris dataset. The project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline from model training to API deployment, following software engineering best practices and clean architecture principles, and includes automated generation of comprehensive API documentation for endpoints.
    * *Key Features:*
        * Clean and intuitive RESTful API endpoints
        * Automated API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
        * Automated ML pipeline with scikit-learn
        * Containerized deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
        * Comprehensive test suite with 95%+ coverage
        * Production-ready configuration and documentation
    * *Tech Stack:*
        * Backend: Python 3.12, Django 5.0, Django REST Framework, drf-yasg (or similar for documentation)
        * ML: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
        * Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose
        * Development: Git, REST APIs
    * *Achievements:*
        * Implemented a clean and maintainable architecture for ML model serving
        * Provided clear and interactive API documentation through automation.
        * Achieved 96.67% accuracy on Iris classification
        * Automated model training and testing in Docker environment
        * Created comprehensive documentation and testing suite
        * Implemented CI/CD best practices with Docker

* **[AI Document Prompt Generator](https://github.com/oscargil/ai-docs-prompt)**
    * *Description:* A tool or script designed to facilitate the creation of effective prompts for AI models by processing and leveraging content from documents. This project explores techniques for extracting relevant information from text documents and formatting it to improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated responses in document-related tasks like summarization, information extraction, or question answering, **and incorporates automated documentation to clearly outline its usage and interface**.
    * *Key Features (Based on project name and common patterns):*
        * Reading and processing document content.
        * Extracting key information or sections from documents.
        * Formatting document data for integration into AI prompts.
        * Potential for supporting various document types (e.g., text, PDF - depending on implementation).
    * *Tech Stack (Based on project name and common patterns):*
        * Python
        * Libraries for document parsing/handling (e.g., `python-docx`, `PyPDF2`, or similar).
        * Libraries for interacting with AI models/APIs (e.g., `transformers`, `openai`, etc.).
    * *Achievements (Based on project goal):*
        * Developed a practical tool to assist in generating AI prompts from document content.
        * Explored methods for preparing document data for AI consumption.
        * Created a foundation for potentially more advanced document-AI interaction tools.
