## Projects Portfolio

Here are some of the projects I'm working on or have completed, showcasing my skills in Software Engineering and AI/ML:

* **[AI Classification API with Django & Docker](https://github.com/oscargil/ai-classification-api)**
    * *Description:* Developed a production-ready REST API that serves real-time predictions for Iris flower classification. The API is built with Django REST Framework and uses a Logistic Regression model trained on the classic Iris dataset. The project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline from model training to API deployment, following software engineering best practices.g
    * *Key Features:*
        * RESTful API with Django REST Framework
        * Machine Learning pipeline with scikit-learn
        * Containerized deployment with Docker
        * Comprehensive API documentation
        * Test suite and CI/CD ready
    * *Tech Stack:* 
        * Backend: Python 3.12, Django 5.0
        * ML: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
        * Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose
        * Development: Git, REST APIs
    * *Achievements:*
        * Implemented a scalable architecture for ML model serving
        * Achieved 95%+ accuracy on Iris classification
        * Containerized the application for consistent deployment
        * Created comprehensive documentation and testing suite
